    <b> How the web works</b>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>the web is a bunch of computers that communicate with each other. When a peson goes to a web page like www.google.com,
       their computer sends a <em>HTTP request</em> to a <em>server</em>. The server
       find the appropriate HTML document and sends it back to the user's computer where a web
       <em>browser</em> interprets the page and displays it on the user's screen.

        Computers are stupid because they interpret instructions literally. this makes them very unforgiving since a small mistake by a programmer can cause huge problems in  a program.
